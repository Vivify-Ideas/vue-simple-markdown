### Lists
#### Unordered list

Start list with characters `*`, `+` or `-`  
Number of spaces before that character => nesting level

```
* First nesting level
 * Second nesting level
   * Third nesting level
          * Tenth nesting level
   * Again third nesting level
```
#### Ordered list

Start list with number and dot. At example `1.`  
Number of spaces before that character => nesting level

```
1. First nesting level
 1. Second nesting level
   1. Third nesting level
          1. Tenth nesting level
   2. Again third nesting level
```

### Blockquotes
```
> First nesting level
>> Second nesting level
>>> Third nesting level
>>>>>>>>>> Tenth nesting level
>>> Again third nesting level
```

### Tables
A table is an arrangement of data with rows and columns, consisting of a single header row, a delimiter row separating the header from the data, and zero or more data rows.
Each row must start and end with pipes (`|`) and it consists of cells containing arbitrary text, in which inlines are parsed, separated by pipes (`|`). Spaces between pipes and cell content are trimmed. Block-level elements cannot be inserted in a table.
Example:
```
| Foo | Bar |
|-----|-----|
| Bam | Baz |
```
| Foo | Bar |
|-----|-----|
| Baz | Bim |

You can use colon (`:`) in the delimiter row to determine content alignment of the corresponding column.
Example:
```
| Align left | Align Right | Align Center | Default |
|:-----------|-:|:---:|--|
| Some text| Some text | Some | alignment |
| aligned to|  aligned to | text |
| the left side| the right side| in the center |
```
| Align left | Align Right | Align Center | Default |
|:-----------|-:|:---:|--|
| Some text| Some text | Some | alignment |
| aligned to|  aligned to | text |
| the left side| the right side| in the center |

Number of columns in each row in the body of the table may vary.
Example:
```
| Column A | Column B | Column C |
|-|-|-|
| You can have | | empty cells |
| This row | is too short |
| This row | has | too many | cells |
```
| Column A | Column B | Column C |
|-|-|-|
| You can have | | empty cells |
| This row | is too short |
| This row | has | too many | cells |


## Development

### Launch visual tests

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Launch Karma with coverage

```bash
npm run dev:coverage
```

### Build

Bundle the js and css of to the `dist` folder:

```bash
npm run build
```


## Publishing

The `prepublish` hook will ensure dist files are created before publishing. This
way you don't need to commit them in your repository.

```bash
# Bump the version first
# It'll also commit it and create a tag
npm version
# Push the bumped package and tags
git push --follow-tags
# Ship it ðŸš€
npm publish
```
